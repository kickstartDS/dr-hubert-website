/**
 * The site's language / URL model, in one place.
 *
 * German is the default language and is served unprefixed from the root
 * (`/`, `/kontakt`, `/produkte`). English lives in an `en` folder in Storyblok
 * and is served from `/en`, `/en/contact`, `/en/products`. Those URLs predate
 * the monorepo migration and have to stay exactly as they are.
 *
 * The starter assumes instead that *every* language carries a prefix, which is
 * why several places used to build `/de/kontakt` and `/en/home` - neither of
 * which exists here. Everything that needs to reason about languages or build
 * a cross-language URL should go through this module rather than re-deriving
 * the rules.
